# CCPD
Chrome Cookie Password Dump

The CCPD will create 2 files, one with login credentials and one with cookies.

You can rename the file from C.C.P.D-windows.py to C.C.P.D-windows.pyw if you do not want a window to pop up.

Do not use it for any malicious acts.

To create an executable file install pyinstaller with pip.

[pip install pyinstaller]
